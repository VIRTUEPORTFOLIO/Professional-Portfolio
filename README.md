# professional-portfolio
My personal site to show my CS projects and skills. Built with basic HTML and CSS.

I built this portfolio to have a central place for my IT applications. I didn't use any heavy frameworks—just pure HTML and CSS—because I wanted to make sure I understood the basics of page layout and responsive design first. It contains my bio, my skill set, and links to the other backend work I’ve been doing.
